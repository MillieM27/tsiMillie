# tsiMillie
The purpose of this program is for the completion of the Testing and Software Improvements submission. I have taken the PythonSimpleCustomer and changed some of the basics to make it slightly different and fixed some formatting. The purpose is to provide a customer book and allow the user to log in and add a customer.
The aim of my task is to create unit tests, fakes, stubs and mocks for the program to demonstrate my knowledge.
